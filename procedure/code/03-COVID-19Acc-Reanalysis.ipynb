    "To perform the ESFCA method, three types of data are required, as follows: (1) road network, (2) population, and (3) hospital information. The road network can be obtained from the [OpenStreetMap Python Library, called OSMNX](https://github.com/gboeing/osmnx). The population data is available on the [American Community Survey](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/deeplinks?url=https%3A%2F%2Ffactfinder.census.gov%2F&tid=GOVSTIMESERIES.CG00ORG01). Lastly, hospital information is also publically available on the [Homelanad Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/hospitals?geometry=-94.504%2C40.632%2C-80.980%2C43.486)."

From here, two more dictionaries are constructed by querying the original one.
